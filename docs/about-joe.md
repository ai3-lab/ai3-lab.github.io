### Principal Investigator & Laboratory Director

![pi-photo-mar-2024-joepohshengyeong](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/341593a4-6cdc-42f7-873d-729627cd9358)

Dr. Joe Yeong Poh Sheng has been listed as World Top 2% scientist since 2024. He is currently a Principal Investigator in the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB, A*STAR), as well as in the Department of Anatomical Pathology, Singapore General Hospital. He has underwent multidisciplinary training which includes clinical (MBBS), immunology (PhD) and histopathology (British Royal College of Pathologist, Fellowship and Mmed (Pathology)). Dr. Joe Yeong’s main research focus is to understand and overcome the resistance of cancer immunotherapy, by using advanced technologies and AI. As an immunopathologist, his key vision is to bridge immunologists and pathologists. He is a pioneer in spatial technologies, translated assays to clinic, and has published > 150 papers in the field (Top 2% Scientist) (>100 invited talks internationally). His works on cancer immunology are included in multiple National & international funded studies as well as industry sponsored projects (>20 million USD since 2017). He served as a committee member in America Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the Co-organizer of World Immunotherapy Council (WIC), Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) as well as the multiplex IF expert consensus meetings. He also serves as one of the founding-Program Chair of one of the largest AI medical Imaging conferences, CLINICCAI-MICCAI and serves as founding board member of MICCAI SIG-ComPath, Board member of Asian Society of Digital Pathology. He is also having editorial roles of Nature Springer, JITC, JCO (ASCO) and World Scientific (Chief Editor). He serves as a Secretary (Executive) in Singapore Society of Oncology – Cancer Immunotherapy Consortium, Co-lead in Education/Diagnostic of Singhealth Duke-NUS Cell Therapy Centre as well as Advisor (Spatial Technology), Cancer Discovery Hub, National Cancer Centre. In 2023, he co-founded World Immunotherapy Council Asian Chapter for promoting tumour immunology and advancing cancer immunotherapy education, information and research across Asia. He is also a regular reviewer for grants from > 15 countries across 5 continents as well as for top journal such as JITC, Mod Path, Lancet, Cell and Nature.

### Contribution to Science

Spatial Technology: Pioneer and key opinion leader (published >130 papers) in the field of mIHC and spatial technologies. He has automated multiplex IHC and developed the world-first multiplex IHC assay for translation (licensed out to the market). For this reason, he now leads multiple global initiative including the Society for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer (SITC) mIF guideline (mxIF-SIG).

AI: Co-founded Clinical Day of International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (CLINICCAI) of the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) to facilitate translation of AI tools to the clinics. He is a regular program chair of CLINICCAI every year and an organiser of MICCAI’s COMPAYL workshop that focuses on digital pathology. He also actively plays a role as a committee member in the Asian Society of Digital Pathology and African Society of Digital Pathology. He has been invited to join the editorial board of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Clinical Cancer Informatics, and regularly reviews AI Pathology paper in top journal such as Nature.

Drug development: Original team member of the first made-in-Singapore ADC (EBC-129) approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for entry into first-in-human studies. Not only did the team identify this drug target, Joe led the team to develop a Companion Diagnostic Assay (CDx) for FDA IND filing, as well as an AI tool to assist patient selection in the clinical trial. The trial is now in Phase 1b, moving towards Phase 2.

Cancer Immunotherapy: Co-founded the SITC World Immunotherapy Council (Asian chapter) and have been leading the global efforts as a SITC-WIC organizer since 2019. He has also been selected to join the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy (PICI) as an affiliated investigator with a funded project. This makes him the only PICI investigator in APAC.

Science: He is listed as the top 2% scientist since 2024. Some of his key scientific findings includes long COVID etiology as persistent virus in the tissue (1), CD39 as a tumor antigen specific T cell marker (2) and AI can be adopted to predict spatial immune signature for personalized medicine (3).
